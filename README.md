Shell Scripting:

	A shell script is usually created for command sequences in which a user has a need to use repeatedly in order to save time.

A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include:

- Automating the code compiling process.
- Running a program or creating a program environment.
- Completing batch
- Manipulating files.
- Linking existing programs together.
- Executing routine backups.
- Monitoring a system.

What is shebang in shell scripting?

	The shebang is the combination of the # (pound key) and ! (exclamation mark). This character combination has a special meaning when it is used in the very first line of the script. It is used to specify the interpreter with which the given script will be run by default.

So, if the first line of a script is: #!/bin/bash - It means the interpreter should be bash shell.
