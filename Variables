A variable is a temporary store for a piece of information. There are two actions we may perform for variables:

- Setting a value for a variable.
- Reading the value for a variable.

> myname=”Demo_Name”
> echo $myname = Prints the value Demo_Name

> now=$(date)
> echo $now = Runs the bash command date

env = To see the list of environment variables
